# Azure Communication Services (ACS) Email Sample

This project demonstrates how to set up and use Azure Communication Services (ACS) for sending emails from your applications. ACS Email provides a reliable, scalable email delivery service that integrates with your Azure ecosystem, allowing you to send transactional emails without managing your own email infrastructure.

## Overview

Azure Communication Services Email capabilities allow you to:
- Send transactional emails through a trusted Microsoft email infrastructure
- Track email delivery statistics
- Use custom domains for sending emails
- Integrate email communications into your applications

## Architecture
![acs-email-relay-architecture](/docs/images/acs-relay-sample-architecture.png)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Azure Developer CLI (azd)**: This tool helps you manage your Azure resources and deployments. Install it by following the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

2. **PowerShell 7+**: For running the email sending scripts, as well as some of the scripting used to create an app registration. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

3. **Python 3.7+** (Optional, for Python examples): For running the Python SDK examples. Install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acs-email-relay-quickstart
   cd acs-email-sample
   ```

2. Sign in to your Azure account using the Azure Developer CLI:
   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

3. Deploy the required Azure resources:
   ```bash
   azd up
   ```
   This command will:
   - Create an app registration
   - Create and store a client secret for the app registration
   - Create an Azure Communication Services resource
   - Configure the email service
   - Set up necessary connections and permissions

4. After deployment completes, note the following from the output:
   - Communication Services resource name
   - App registration ID
   - App registration tenant ID
   - Client secret (securely stored in the azd environment as AZURE_APP_REGISTRATION_CLIENT_SECRET)

## Usage

### Important Note About Sender Email Address

When sending emails through ACS, you must use the Azure-managed domain that was assigned to your service. All required configuration values are stored in your azd environment variables after deployment.

### Sending Emails with PowerShell

After deployment, you can use PowerShell to send emails through ACS. All required values are stored in your azd environment:

```powershell
# Get the environment variables from azd
$azdenv = azd env get-values --output json | ConvertFrom-Json

# Set up credentials for SMTP authentication
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force -String $azdenv.AZURE_APP_REGISTRATION_CLIENT_SECRET
$Cred = New-Object -TypeName PSCredential -ArgumentList "$($azdenv.ACS_NAME)|$($azdenv.AZURE_APP_REGISTRATION_CLIENT_ID)|$($azdenv.AZURE_TENANT_ID)", $Password

# Send a simple email
Send-MailMessage -From "DoNotReply@$($azdenv.FROM_SENDER_DOMAIN)" -To 'recipient@example.com' -Subject 'Test mail' -Body 'This is a test email from Azure Communication Services' -SmtpServer 'smtp.azurecomm.net' -Port 587 -Credential $Cred -UseSsl

# Send an email with HTML content
Send-MailMessage -From "DoNotReply@$($azdenv.FROM_SENDER_DOMAIN)" -To 'recipient@example.com' -Subject 'HTML Test mail' -BodyAsHtml -Body '<h1>Hello</h1><p>This is an <strong>HTML</strong> email.</p>' -SmtpServer 'smtp.azurecomm.net' -Port 587 -Credential $Cred -UseSsl

# Send an email with attachments
Send-MailMessage -From "DoNotReply@$($azdenv.FROM_SENDER_DOMAIN)" -To 'recipient@example.com' -Subject 'Email with attachment' -Body 'Please see the attached document.' -Attachments 'path/to/your/file.pdf' -SmtpServer 'smtp.azurecomm.net' -Port 587 -Credential $Cred -UseSsl
```

Note: Simply replace 'recipient@example.com' with your desired recipient email address.

### Using in Applications

To integrate email sending into your applications, you can use:

- **REST API**: Directly call the ACS Email API
- **SDKs**: Use the Azure Communication Services SDKs available for multiple languages
- **SMTP**: Connect using standard SMTP protocols as shown above

#### Python SDK Example

This repository includes Python examples in the `app` directory that can run independently from the AZD deployment or use the managed identity that the AZD deployment creates. This examples leverages `uv` for python env and dependency management.

Before running the examples, be sure to:
1. Configure your environment variables in the `.env` file
2. Update the recipient email addresses in the scripts

Authentication options for the Python examples:
1. **Managed Identity**: If you deployed using `azd up`, a user-assigned managed identity is already created and can be used for secure authentication.
2. **DefaultAzureCredential**: Uses your `az login` credentials for local development.
3. **Connection String** or **Access Key**: Can be used for testing but not recommended for production.

The Python examples can also be deployed as standalone applications or containers. See the [Python app README](app/README.md) for deployment options and more details.

For more information about implementation options, see the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview).

After you have set your `.env` file, you can run the sample app from your command line using the commands below:
```bash
# Navigate to the app directory
cd app

# Install required dependencies
uv sync

# Send email to multiple recipients
uv run send_email.py
```


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**:
   - Verify your Entra Application credentials
   - Ensure your app registration has the correct permissions
   - Check that your client secret hasn't expired

2. **Email Delivery Issues**:
   - Verify recipient email addresses are correctly formatted
   - Check spam folders if emails aren't arriving
   - Review ACS metrics in the Azure portal for delivery statistics

3. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient permissions in your Azure subscription
   - Check the Azure CLI is properly authenticated
   - Review error messages in the deployment logs
